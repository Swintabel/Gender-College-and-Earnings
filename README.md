# Gender-College-and-Earnings
Data visualization in R

#### MOTIVATION

The relevance of employment is really earnings. Simple macro economics says that, higher incomes reflect in higher consumption and higher demand leading to high overall motivation for increased production which facilitates development. This is the reasons why employment is a sensitive topic in relation to developemnt and the more reason I want to dedicate this project to exploring an interesting topic of the relationship that exists amongst earnings, gender and college courses. 

Some researchers say that the low earnings of graduates are as a result of poor choices of college courses, there are others who have also said that gender is major determining factor of earnings.

In this project, I will be exploring the relationship that exists amongst college majors, an individual's gender and earnings with a dataset generated from some college graduates between 2010 and 2012. The dataset I would be using can be found at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/samaxtech/college-earnings-by-major).


#### DATASET

The dataset I would be using for this project is called  recent-grad.csv. As mentioned above, I retrieved it from Kaggle. According to another [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/suugaku/dataquest-visualizing-earnings-by-college-major), the data was initially collected and aggregated by the [AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html). The current version of the data I will be using was extracted from the original data by [fiftythirtytwo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

According to [fiftythirtytwo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors), these are the detailed desription of the various variables in the dataset.

#### ORIGINAL PROBLEM AND QUESTIONS OF INQUIRY 

The original reason for this version of the dataset was the story; [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/). The major points made by this story was the fact that some Engineering and science courses are the courses that pay on the job market. However, majority of students offer courses that are not as rewarding in terms of earnings and jobs like Psychology and other social sciences. Likewise, some reseachers also say that the jobs that primarily employ men tend to pay more than the jobs that primarily employ women; Also, One year after graduation, a pay gap exists between women and men who majored in the same field (Christianne & Catherine, 2012, pp.2). Many college majors that lead to high-paying roles in tech and engineering are male dominated, while majors that lead to lower-paying roles in social sciences and liberal arts tend to be female-dominated, placing men in higher-paying career pathways, on average (Andrew & Jyotsna, 2017,pp.2).

These conclusions by these researchers have propelled me to explore this dataset to have a view into the relationships that exist amongst college courses, gender and earnings. In particular, I am curious to find some answers to the following questions:

1. What relationship exists between gender share of a college course and potential earnings?

2. What relationship exists between college courses and earnings?

3. What relationship exists between gender and college courses?

4. How much does gender and college course together determine earnings?


#### SCOPE OF SOLUTION

To help me find solutions to my above stated questions, I would be using GGPLOT2 for visualization.

I may not need certain variables in the dataset and hence, they would be silent variables in my analysis.  

I will first explore a one-to-one relatioships between my variables of interest and then look out for any interractions therein.

For every visualization i would explain the story told and see if it supports previous research on the topic and then, what i can make of the story.

In the concluding part of my visualization, i will put together my findings and recommend other projects worth exploring in this data.

Lastly, since my focus here is visualization, I would not be showing any preliminary data cleaning that i would be doing.
